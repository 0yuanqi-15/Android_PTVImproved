# Improved Public Transport Victoria App (Android Version)

## Project Information

This is the Android version of the PTV timetable lookup software, designed for users in Victoria, Australia. The data source and copyright belong to Public Transport Victoria. For the iOS version, check [here](https://github.com/DanistyWuKids/iOS_PTV_Improved).

## Application Installation & Requirements

The application requires Android 7.0.0 or higher to run. End users can download the APK directly from the [release](https://github.com/DanistyWuKids/Android_PTVImproved/releases/) tab. This application is implemented in Java.

## Basic Features

1. Save your favorite routes and stops.
2. Search for any routes and stops as you prefer.
3. Select stops to look up timetables from the map.
4. Open the PTV journey planner.
5. Display disruptions on networks.
6. Show route paths and timetables for specific services.
7. Display your nearest stops based on your location.
8. Show the closest stops to a route.

* We are currently trialing the use of Bing Maps to display points of interest. This is intended to support future development for worldwide map access and GTFS information implementation.
